Voting Ensemble Learning - Improving Model Performance 🚀
Overview
This project explores Voting Classifiers, a powerful ensemble learning technique that combines multiple machine learning models to improve accuracy. We implement both Hard Voting and Soft Voting classifiers on the Iris dataset to demonstrate their effectiveness.

Key Concepts
🔹 Hard Voting: Predicts the majority class based on individual model votes.
🔹 Soft Voting: Averages predicted probabilities from multiple models for better performance.
🔹 Ensemble Learning: Combines diverse models to improve generalization and robustness.

Dataset
📌 Iris Dataset - A well-known dataset for classification problems, containing features of different iris flower species.
